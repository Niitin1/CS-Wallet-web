<h2>What's CS web-wallet?</h2>
<p>CREDITS Web Wallet is a client interface for secure and easy interaction with peer-to-peer network, easy to use, flexible, easy-to-configure.
CREDITS Web Wallet allows without installing a complete node, transfer currency from one user to another and perform operations with an already deployed smart contract, if there is no need for its self-compilation. Synchronization with the network is performed automatically in real time. Connection to the peer-to-peer network is carried out using the platform API.
The current functionality of Web Wallet is completely analogous to Wallet Desktop, except for the possibility of creating and downloading new smart contracts.
Current Functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the balance</li>
<li>View transaction history</li>
<li>View transactions with smart contracts</li>
<li>Create a transaction</li>
<li>Creating a new token, using a smart contract</li>
<li>Operations with deployed (existing) smart contracts</li>
</ul>
